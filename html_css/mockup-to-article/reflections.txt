You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
 * What has been difficult?
 * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?
  
Technical terms. Although I am relatively familiar with most of the lessons thus far, I realized it was difficult for me to talk about the things I knew because I wasn't as familiar with the technical terms.

* What has been easy?
  
Following quizzes and completing them successfully, as well as setting up my environment (installing atom, the Chrome extension, etc)

* What has been difficult?
  
Staying focused. Because of my familiarity with HTML, part of me wants to skip through to the things I'm less familiar with, but I recognize each step is essential and I can learn things I had not learned in the past (such as technical terms).
